Scenario 1: Validating BMI Calculation with Normal Input
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_calculation_normal_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the calculate_bmi function correctly computes the BMI for valid height and weight inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize height and weight variables with normal values.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with the initialized height and weight parameters.
  Assert: The outcome should be the expected BMI value, calculated manually for the given height and weight.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly computes the BMI for normal inputs. It validates the core functionality of the calculate_bmi function.

Scenario 2: Validating BMI Calculation with Edge Case Input
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_calculation_edge_case_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the calculate_bmi function correctly handles edge case inputs for height and weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize height and weight variables with edge case values (e.g., extremely high or low values).
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with the initialized height and weight parameters.
  Assert: The outcome should be the expected BMI value, calculated manually for the given height and weight.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle edge cases and still produce accurate results. It validates the robustness of the calculate_bmi function.

Scenario 3: Validating BMI Calculation with Zero Input
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_calculation_zero_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the calculate_bmi function correctly handles zero inputs for height and weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize height and/or weight variables with a zero value.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with the initialized height and weight parameters.
  Assert: The function should raise an appropriate exception or return an appropriate error message (depending on the function's design), as BMI cannot be calculated with zero height or weight.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles invalid inputs and prevents division by zero errors. It validates the error handling of the calculate_bmi function.

Scenario 4: Validating BMI Calculation with Negative Input
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_calculation_negative_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the calculate_bmi function correctly handles negative inputs for height and weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize height and/or weight variables with a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with the initialized height and weight parameters.
  Assert: The function should raise an appropriate exception or return an appropriate error message (depending on the function's design), as BMI cannot be calculated with negative height or weight.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles invalid inputs and prevents nonsensical results. It validates the error handling of the calculate_bmi function.
