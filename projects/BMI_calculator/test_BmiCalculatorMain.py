```
Scenario 1: Calculate BMI with valid height and weight
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_bmi_valid_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correctness of the BMI calculation given valid height and weight inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: The height and weight values should be positive real numbers.
  Act: The calculate_bmi function will be invoked with these height and weight values.
  Assert: The returned float value should match the expected BMI value (manually calculated using the same inputs).
Validation:
  This test validates the core functionality of the BMI calculator. A correct calculation is essential for the accuracy of the subsequent interpretation.

Scenario 2: Interpretation of calculated BMI
Details:
  TestName: test_interpret_bmi
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct interpretation of the calculated BMI.
Execution:
  Arrange: A set of valid BMI values covering all categories of the interpretation.
  Act: The interpret_bmi function will be invoked with these BMI values.
  Assert: The returned string should match the expected interpretation for each BMI value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the BMI calculator correctly interprets the calculated BMI, providing meaningful feedback to the user.

Scenario 3: Handling of zero height in BMI calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_bmi_zero_height
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the calculate_bmi function handles a zero height input correctly without throwing errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: The height value is set to zero, and a valid weight value is provided.
  Act: The calculate_bmi function will be invoked with these height and weight values.
  Assert: The function should return None.
Validation:
  This test confirms the application's robustness in handling edge cases and invalid inputs, ensuring that it doesn't crash and provides appropriate feedback.

Scenario 4: Interpretation of null BMI
Details:
  TestName: test_interpret_bmi_null
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the interpret_bmi function handles a null BMI input correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: The BMI value is set to None.
  Act: The interpret_bmi function will be invoked with this BMI value.
  Assert: The function should return a message indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the application correctly handles cases where the BMI could not be calculated due to invalid inputs, providing meaningful feedback to the user.
