Scenario 1: User chooses heads and the toss result is also heads
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_user_wins_with_heads
  Description: This test verifies that when the user chooses heads (1) and the toss result is also heads (1), the function returns 1 indicating player 1 wins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return 1. Mock the random function to return 1.
  Act: Call the function toss().
  Assert: Check that the return value is 1.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that when the user's choice matches the toss result, the function correctly identifies the user as the winner.

Scenario 2: User chooses tails and the toss result is also tails
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_user_wins_with_tails
  Description: This test verifies that when the user chooses tails (2) and the toss result is also tails (2), the function returns 1 indicating player 1 wins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return 2. Mock the random function to return 2.
  Act: Call the function toss().
  Assert: Check that the return value is 1.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that when the user's choice matches the toss result, the function correctly identifies the user as the winner.

Scenario 3: User chooses heads but the toss result is tails
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_user_loses_with_heads
  Description: This test verifies that when the user chooses heads (1) but the toss result is tails (2), the function returns 2 indicating player 2 wins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return 1. Mock the random function to return 2.
  Act: Call the function toss().
  Assert: Check that the return value is 2.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that when the user's choice does not match the toss result, the function correctly identifies the other player as the winner.

Scenario 4: User chooses tails but the toss result is heads
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_user_loses_with_tails
  Description: This test verifies that when the user chooses tails (2) but the toss result is heads (1), the function returns 2 indicating player 2 wins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return 2. Mock the random function to return 1.
  Act: Call the function toss().
  Assert: Check that the return value is 2.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that when the user's choice does not match the toss result, the function correctly identifies the other player as the winner.
