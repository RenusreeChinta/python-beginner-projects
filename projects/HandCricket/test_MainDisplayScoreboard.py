```
Scenario 1: Validate the display of the scoreboard with positive scores and over
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_positive_scores
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct display of the scores and over when all parameters are positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player1_score, player2_score, and over with positive integer values.
  Act: Invoke the function display_scoreboard with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected string which includes the scores of both players and the over.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function correctly displays the scores and over when all inputs are positive integers, which is a typical case in a cricket game.

Scenario 2: Validate the display of the scoreboard with zero scores and over
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_zero_scores
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct display of the scores and over when all parameters are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player1_score, player2_score, and over with zero.
  Act: Invoke the function display_scoreboard with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected string which includes the scores of both players and the over as zero.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly displays the scores and over when all inputs are zero, which is a possible case at the start of a cricket game.

Scenario 3: Validate the display of the scoreboard with mixed scores and over
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_mixed_scores
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct display of the scores and over when the parameters are a mix of positive integers and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player1_score, player2_score, and over with a mix of positive integers and zero.
  Act: Invoke the function display_scoreboard with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected string which includes the scores of both players and the over as per the inputs.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function correctly displays the scores and over when the inputs are a mix of positive integers and zero, which is a likely scenario during a cricket game.
```
NOTE: The function display_scoreboard only prints to the console and does not return anything, so the above test scenarios would require capturing the console output to compare it with the expected output.
