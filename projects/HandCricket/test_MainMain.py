Scenario 1: Validate the correct winner is determined based on the score
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_winner
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly determines the winner based on the scores of player1 and player2.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with a predetermined set of scores for both players.
  Act: Invoke the who_won function with player1_score and player2_score as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly identifies the player with the higher score as the winner.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the integrity of the game. The player with the higher score should be declared as the winner as per the rules of the game.

Scenario 2: Validate the game handles a draw correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_game_draw
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies a draw when both players have the same score.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with the same score for both players.
  Act: Invoke the who_won function with the scores of both players.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly identifies the match as a draw.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the game correctly handles situations where both players have the same score, which should result in a draw.

Scenario 3: Validate toss function correctly assigns players
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_function
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the toss function correctly assigns the batting and bowling order based on the toss result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with a predetermined toss result.
  Act: Invoke the toss function and then check the player1_choice and player2_choice.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly assigns the batting and bowling order based on the toss result.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toss function correctly assigns the batting and bowling order, which is a crucial part of the game's logic.

Scenario 4: Validate the game handles invalid input gracefully
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles invalid input (such as non-numeric input for number of overs) gracefully by exiting the game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with invalid input.
  Act: Invoke the main function with the invalid input.
  Assert: Check if the function handles the invalid input by exiting the game and printing an appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game can handle unexpected or invalid input from the user gracefully, which is essential for a robust user experience. 

Scenario 5: Validate the correct number of overs in a game
Details:
  TestName: test_number_of_overs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the game correctly plays the specified number of overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with a predetermined number of overs.
  Act: Invoke the play_game function with the specified number of overs.
  Assert: Check if the game correctly plays the specified number of overs.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game correctly plays the specified number of overs, which is a crucial part of the game's rules.
