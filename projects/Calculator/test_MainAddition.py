Scenario 1: Test with valid input
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_valid_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function is able to correctly sum numbers provided by the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string of numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals the expected sum of the numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the fundamental functionality of the function. The expected result is directly connected to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Test with negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function can handle negative numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string of positive and negative numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals the expected sum of the numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle negative numbers, which is a valid scenario in real-world applications.

Scenario 3: Test with large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_large_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function can handle large numbers without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string of large numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals the expected sum of the numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's ability to handle large numbers, which can occur in real-world applications.

Scenario 4: Test with no input
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_no_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function can handle a scenario where no numbers are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals 0, since the sum of no numbers is 0.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's ability to handle edge cases, ensuring robustness of the function.
