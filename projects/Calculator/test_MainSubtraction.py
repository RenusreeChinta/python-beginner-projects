Scenario 1: Testing subtraction of two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_positive_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly subtracts two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive numbers.
  Act: Invoke the function subtraction with the two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is correct.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The subtraction of two positive numbers is a basic operation that the function should be able to perform correctly. Confirming this behavior ensures the function's basic functionality.

Scenario 2: Testing subtraction of positive and negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_positive_and_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly subtracts a negative number from a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive number and a negative number.
  Act: Invoke the function subtraction with the two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is correct.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The subtraction of a positive number and a negative number is a common operation that the function should be able to perform correctly. This test ensures that the function can handle such scenarios.

Scenario 3: Testing subtraction of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly subtracts two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative numbers.
  Act: Invoke the function subtraction with the two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is correct.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The subtraction of two negative numbers is a common operation that the function should be able to perform correctly. This test ensures that the function can handle such scenarios.

Scenario 4: Testing subtraction of zero and a positive number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_zero_and_positive_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly subtracts a positive number from zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize zero and a positive number.
  Act: Invoke the function subtraction with the two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is correct.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The subtraction of zero and a positive number is a common operation that the function should be able to perform correctly. This test ensures that the function can handle such scenarios.

Scenario 5: Testing subtraction of zero and a negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_zero_and_negative_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly subtracts a negative number from zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize zero and a negative number.
  Act: Invoke the function subtraction with the two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is correct.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The subtraction of zero and a negative number is a common operation that the function should be able to perform correctly. This test ensures that the function can handle such scenarios.
