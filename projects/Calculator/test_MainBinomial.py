Scenario 1: Test Binomial Coefficient Calculation with Valid Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_binomial_valid_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct calculation of the binomial coefficient when provided with valid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a tuple with two positive integers.
  Act: Invoke the binomial function with the tuple as the parameter.
  Assert: Check if the returned value matches the expected binomial coefficient.
Validation:
  The binomial coefficient is a fundamental operation in combinatorics. Accurate calculation is crucial for any business logic that relies on this function.

Scenario 2: Test Binomial Coefficient Calculation when n is less than k
Details:
  TestName: test_binomial_n_less_than_k
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the binomial function when the first number in the tuple (num[0]) is less than the second number (num[1]).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a tuple where the first number is less than the second number.
  Act: Invoke the binomial function with the tuple as the parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function raises an appropriate error or returns 0 as mathematically, binomial coefficient is defined as zero for these cases.
Validation:
  Handling of edge cases is crucial for robustness of the function. This test ensures that the function behaves as expected in such situations.

Scenario 3: Test Binomial Coefficient Calculation with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_binomial_with_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the binomial function when one or both of the numbers in the tuple are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a tuple with one or both numbers as zero.
  Act: Invoke the binomial function with the tuple as the parameter.
  Assert: Check if the returned value matches the expected binomial coefficient according to mathematical rules.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles scenarios involving zero, which are common in practical applications of binomial coefficients.

Scenario 4: Test Binomial Coefficient Calculation with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_binomial_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the binomial function when one or both of the numbers in the tuple are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a tuple with one or both numbers as negative.
  Act: Invoke the binomial function with the tuple as the parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function raises an appropriate error as binomial coefficient is not defined for negative numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles scenarios involving negative numbers, enhancing the robustness of the function.
