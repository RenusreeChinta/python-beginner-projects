Scenario 1: Testing with positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_positive_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function calculates the average correctly for a list of positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of positive integer values.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared list of positive integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is the expected average of the list.
Validation:
  The test is important to ensure that the function correctly calculates the average of a list of positive integers. This is a basic requirement for the function as per its specifications.

Scenario 2: Testing with negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_negative_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function calculates the average correctly for a list of negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of negative integer values.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared list of negative integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is the expected average of the list.
Validation:
  The test is important to ensure that the function correctly calculates the average of a list of negative integers. This checks the function's ability to handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Testing with mixed positive and negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_mixed_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function calculates the average correctly for a list of mixed positive and negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of mixed positive and negative integer values.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared list of mixed integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is the expected average of the list.
Validation:
  The test is important to ensure that the function correctly calculates the average of a list of mixed integers. This checks the function's ability to handle mixed numbers.

Scenario 4: Testing with an empty list
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_empty_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function handles an empty list correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty list.
  Act: Invoke the function with the empty list.
  Assert: Check if the function throws an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  The test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles an empty list. This checks the function's robustness in handling edge cases.

Scenario 5: Testing with a single number
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_single_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function calculates the average correctly for a list with a single number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list with a single number.
  Act: Invoke the function with the single number list.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is the same as the single number.
Validation:
  The test is important to ensure that the function correctly calculates the average of a list with a single number. This checks the function's ability to handle minimal input.
