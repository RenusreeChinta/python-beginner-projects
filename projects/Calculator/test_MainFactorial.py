Scenario 1: Testing factorial function with a positive integer
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_positive_integer
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the factorial function is correctly calculating the factorial of a positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the function takes a single integer as input.
  Act: Invoke the function with a positive integer, such as 5.
  Assert: The expected outcome would be the factorial of the input number. For this example, the expected result would be 120.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly calculates the factorial of positive integers, which is the primary requirement of the function. 

Scenario 2: Testing factorial function with zero as input
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the factorial function is correctly handling the edge case where the input is 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the function takes a single integer as input.
  Act: Invoke the function with 0 as the input.
  Assert: The expected outcome would be 1, as the factorial of 0 is 1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle edge cases correctly, which is a crucial aspect of any function's robustness and reliability. 

Scenario 3: Testing factorial function with a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_negative_integer
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the factorial function handles negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the function takes a single integer as input.
  Act: Invoke the function with a negative integer, such as -5.
  Assert: Since the factorial of a negative number is undefined, the function's behavior is undefined. However, for this test scenario, we can expect the function to return 1.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function handles negative integers safely. This is important to prevent unexpected errors or crashes when the function encounters unexpected input. 

Scenario 4: Testing factorial function with large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_large_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the factorial function handles large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the function takes a single integer as input.
  Act: Invoke the function with a large number, such as 100.
  Assert: The expected outcome would be the factorial of the input number. However, due to the large size of the result, it may be more practical to check that the function returns without error and within a reasonable time frame.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is capable of handling large inputs without causing errors or excessive processing times. This is important for ensuring the function's performance and reliability.
