```
Scenario 1: Test complex addition with multiple numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_addition
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct execution of complex addition with multiple numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of complex numbers as a string with real and imaginary parts separated by space.
  Act: Invoke the function complex_arithmetic with "1" as choice and the prepared list as input.
  Assert: Check if the returned string from the function matches the expected result of the complex addition.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly add multiple complex numbers, ensuring the correctness of this basic arithmetic operation.

Scenario 2: Test complex subtraction with multiple numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_subtraction
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct execution of complex subtraction with multiple numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of complex numbers as a string with real and imaginary parts separated by space.
  Act: Invoke the function complex_arithmetic with "2" as choice and the prepared list as input.
  Assert: Check if the returned string from the function matches the expected result of the complex subtraction.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly subtract multiple complex numbers, ensuring the correctness of this basic arithmetic operation.

Scenario 3: Test complex multiplication with two numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_multiplication
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct execution of complex multiplication with two numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of two complex numbers as a string with real and imaginary parts separated by space.
  Act: Invoke the function complex_arithmetic with "3" as choice and the prepared list as input.
  Assert: Check if the returned string from the function matches the expected result of the complex multiplication.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly multiply two complex numbers, ensuring the correctness of this arithmetic operation.

Scenario 4: Test complex division with two numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_division
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct execution of complex division with two numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of two complex numbers as a string with real and imaginary parts separated by space.
  Act: Invoke the function complex_arithmetic with "4" as choice and the prepared list as input.
  Assert: Check if the returned string from the function matches the expected result of the complex division.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly divide two complex numbers, ensuring the correctness of this arithmetic operation.

Scenario 5: Test the behavior when the user inputs an invalid choice
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_choice
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the function when the user inputs an invalid choice.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the function complex_arithmetic with an invalid choice (not 1, 2, 3, or 4).
  Assert: Check if the function returns None or an appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's robustness in handling invalid user inputs, ensuring it does not crash or behave unexpectedly when presented with such inputs.
