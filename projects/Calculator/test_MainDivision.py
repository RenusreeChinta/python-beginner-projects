Scenario 1: Testing division of two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_positive_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly divides two positive numbers and returns the expected result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive numbers, n1 and n2.
  Act: Invoke the function division with n1 and n2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals the expected result of n1 divided by n2.
Validation:
  The successful execution of the division operation for two positive numbers demonstrates the basic functionality of the function, which is a primary requirement for its business logic.

Scenario 2: Testing division of a number by zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles a division by zero scenario and returns an "Invalid entry" message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two numbers, n1 and n2 with n2 being zero.
  Act: Invoke the function division with n1 and n2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals "Invalid entry".
Validation:
  The handling of division by zero is crucial for the function to avoid runtime errors and crashes. This test ensures that the function meets this requirement.

Scenario 3: Testing division of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly divides two negative numbers and returns the expected positive result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative numbers, n1 and n2.
  Act: Invoke the function division with n1 and n2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals the expected result of n1 divided by n2.
Validation:
  The function should be able to handle negative numbers, and this test verifies this requirement.

Scenario 4: Testing division of a positive number by a negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_positive_by_negative
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly divides a positive number by a negative number and returns the expected negative result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize n1 as a positive number and n2 as a negative number.
  Act: Invoke the function division with n1 and n2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals the expected result of n1 divided by n2.
Validation:
  The function should correctly handle division of a positive number by a negative number, and this test verifies this requirement.
