Scenario 1: Test positive number modulo 26
Details:
  TestName: test_mod_with_positive_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly returns the modulo of a positive number with 26.
Execution:
  Arrange: No particular setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the function with a positive number as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome would be the remainder when the input number is divided by 26.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function is correctly implementing the modulo operation for positive numbers. The expected result is derived directly from the mathematical definition of the modulo operation.

Scenario 2: Test negative number modulo 26
Details:
  TestName: test_mod_with_negative_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly returns the modulo of a negative number with 26.
Execution:
  Arrange: No particular setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the function with a negative number as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome would be 26 minus the remainder when the absolute value of the input number is divided by 26.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function is correctly implementing the modulo operation for negative numbers. The expected result is derived directly from the mathematical definition of the modulo operation.

Scenario 3: Test zero modulo 26
Details:
  TestName: test_mod_with_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly returns the modulo of zero with 26.
Execution:
  Arrange: No particular setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the function with zero as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome would be zero because zero modulo any number is always zero.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function is correctly implementing the modulo operation for zero. The expected result is derived directly from the mathematical definition of the modulo operation.

Scenario 4: Test modulo 26 with a large positive number
Details:
  TestName: test_mod_with_large_positive_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle large positive numbers and still correctly return the modulo with 26.
Execution:
  Arrange: No particular setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the function with a large positive number as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome would be the remainder when the input number is divided by 26.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function can handle large numbers and still correctly implement the modulo operation. The expected result is derived directly from the mathematical definition of the modulo operation.

Scenario 5: Test modulo 26 with a large negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_mod_with_large_negative_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle large negative numbers and still correctly return the modulo with 26.
Execution:
  Arrange: No particular setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the function with a large negative number as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome would be 26 minus the remainder when the absolute value of the input number is divided by 26.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function can handle large numbers and still correctly implement the modulo operation. The expected result is derived directly from the mathematical definition of the modulo operation.
