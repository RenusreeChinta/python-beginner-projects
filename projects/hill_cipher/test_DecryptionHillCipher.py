Scenario 1: Validating the cipher text for a given text and key matrix
Details:
  TestName: test_hill_cipher_valid_output
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function hill_cipher correctly generates cipher text for a given input text and key matrix.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a text string and a key matrix.
  Act: Invoke the hill_cipher function with the initialized text string and key matrix as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected cipher text.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the connection of the expected result to the function's specifications and business requirements. This test ensures that the function correctly implements the Hill cipher algorithm, which is crucial for the application's security requirements.

Scenario 2: Testing the hill_cipher function when the input text length is not a multiple of 3
Details:
  TestName: test_hill_cipher_invalid_text_length
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function hill_cipher handles the scenario where the input text length is not a multiple of 3.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a text string with a length not a multiple of 3 and a key matrix.
  Act: Invoke the hill_cipher function with the initialized text string and key matrix as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected outcome (either an error message or a cipher text with padding).
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases, which is crucial for the robustness of the application.

Scenario 3: Testing the hill_cipher function for different key matrices
Details:
  TestName: test_hill_cipher_different_key_matrices
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function hill_cipher generates different cipher texts for different key matrices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a text string and two different key matrices.
  Act: Invoke the hill_cipher function twice with the same text string but different key matrices each time.
  Assert: Check if the two outputs are different.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly uses the key matrix in the encryption process, which is crucial for the security of the application.

Scenario 4: Testing the hill_cipher function for empty text
Details:
  TestName: test_hill_cipher_empty_text
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function hill_cipher handles the scenario where the input text is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty text string and a key matrix.
  Act: Invoke the hill_cipher function with the initialized empty text string and key matrix as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected outcome (either an error message or an empty cipher text).
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases, which is crucial for the robustness of the application.
