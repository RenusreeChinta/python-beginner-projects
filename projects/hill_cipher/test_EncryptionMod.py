Scenario 1: Test positive number modulo 26
Details:
  TestName: test_mod_with_positive_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the mod function returns the correct modulo 26 of a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No particular setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the mod function with a positive number as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the correct modulo 26 of the input number.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly calculates modulo 26 for positive numbers, which is a core part of its functionality.

Scenario 2: Test negative number modulo 26
Details:
  TestName: test_mod_with_negative_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the mod function returns the correct modulo 26 of a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No particular setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the mod function with a negative number as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the correct modulo 26 of the input number.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly calculates modulo 26 for negative numbers, which is a core part of its functionality.

Scenario 3: Test zero modulo 26
Details:
  TestName: test_mod_with_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the mod function returns zero when given zero as an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No particular setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the mod function with zero as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles zero as input, returning zero as the output.

Scenario 4: Test large number modulo 26
Details:
  TestName: test_mod_with_large_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the mod function can handle large numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No particular setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the mod function with a large number as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the correct modulo 26 of the input number.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function can handle large numbers without crashing or returning incorrect results. The correct handling of large numbers is a requirement for this function to be robust and reliable.
