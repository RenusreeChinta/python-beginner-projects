Scenario 1: Verify the behavior when a leap year is passed as input
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_leap_year
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies a leap year. Leap years are every year evenly divisible by 4, except for years which are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the function operates on the input directly.
  Act: Invoke the function with a known leap year, such as 2000 or 2020.
  Assert: The expected outcome is True, indicating the year is a leap year.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly implements the rules for determining leap years, which is critical for accurate date calculations.

Scenario 2: Verify the behavior when a non-leap year is passed as input
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_non_leap_year
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the function operates on the input directly.
  Act: Invoke the function with a known non-leap year, such as 2001 or 2019.
  Assert: The expected outcome is False, indicating the year is not a leap year.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly distinguishes non-leap years, which is essential for accurate date calculations.

Scenario 3: Verify the behavior with a year divisible by 100 but not by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_not_divisible_by_400
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400 as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the function operates on the input directly.
  Act: Invoke the function with a year like 1900 or 2100 which are divisible by 100 but not by 400.
  Assert: The expected outcome is False, indicating the year is not a leap year.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly implements the rule that years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are not leap years. This is a subtle point of the leap year rules that is often overlooked, so it's important to test it explicitly.

Scenario 4: Verify the behavior with a year that is less than 1
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_year_less_than_1
  Description: The test is intended to verify the behavior of the function when a year less than 1 is passed as input. As the Gregorian calendar starts from the year 1, this is considered an invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required as the function operates on the input directly.
  Act: Invoke the function with a year like 0 or -100.
  Assert: The expected outcome is not defined in this function. Depending on the implementation of the isleap function from the calendar module, this could either raise an exception or return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles invalid inputs in a reasonable way. This is important for robustness and error handling.
