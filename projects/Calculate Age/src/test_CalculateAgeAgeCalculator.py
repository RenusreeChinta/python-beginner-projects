Scenario 1: Verify age calculation for non-leap years
Details:
  TestName: test_age_calculation_non_leap_year
  Description: This test is designed to verify the age calculation of the user in years, months, and days for non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the user's name and age. The age should be set based on a non-leap year.
  Act: Invoke the age_calculator function with the initialized name and age.
  Assert: The returned string should correctly represent the user's age in years, months, and days.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the age calculation logic works correctly for non-leap years, which is a fundamental requirement of the function.

Scenario 2: Verify age calculation for leap years
Details:
  TestName: test_age_calculation_leap_year
  Description: This test is intended to verify the age calculation of the user in years, months, and days for leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the user's name and age. The age should be set based on a leap year.
  Act: Invoke the age_calculator function with the initialized name and age.
  Assert: The returned string should correctly represent the user's age in years, months, and days, considering the extra day in leap years.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the age calculation logic correctly handles leap years, which have an extra day compared to non-leap years.

Scenario 3: Verify age calculation for a user born in the current month
Details:
  TestName: test_age_calculation_current_month
  Description: This test is intended to verify the age calculation of the user in years, months, and days for a user who is born in the current month.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the user's name and age. The age should be set such that the user's birth month is the current month.
  Act: Invoke the age_calculator function with the initialized name and age.
  Assert: The returned string should correctly represent the user's age in years, months, and days, considering the current day of the month.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the age calculation logic correctly handles cases where the user's birth month is the current month.

Scenario 4: Verify age calculation for a user aged zero years
Details:
  TestName: test_age_calculation_zero_years
  Description: This test is intended to verify the age calculation of the user in years, months, and days for a user whose age is zero years.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the user's name and age as zero.
  Act: Invoke the age_calculator function with the initialized name and age.
  Assert: The returned string should correctly represent the user's age as zero years, zero months, and zero days.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the age calculation logic correctly handles cases where the user's age is zero years, which could be a boundary case for the function.
